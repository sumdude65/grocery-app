          Born and raised in Nigeria, Values such as hardwork, honesty,
          dilligence, and taking pride in one's work were imbibed in me from a
          very early age. These values have since transferred into everything I
          do including when I discovered programming. The challenge posed by the
          problem-solving aspect as well as the creativity involved made me fall
          deeply inlove with it. Ever since I have continuously worked to
          improve myself as a better programmer armed with the latest
          technologies and best practises for providing value to people's lives.
          If you would like to work with someone who can help bring your idea to
          life and/or work in a team, reach out and let's have a chat.
